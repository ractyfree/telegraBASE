> I will take your routine on me.

### What is this?
This is a framework which has lots of stuff internally to make bots easily and faster.

### Who can it help?
Such framework should help anyone who wants to make Telegram bots.

### Features:
- A little modified version of pyTelegramBotApi
- Stable working with bad connection or even with the unstable Internet itself
- Brilliant messages routing to bot's functions
- User, Userpool classes to use in the bots development process

### Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- and all dependencies from pyTelegramBotApi


## Coding stuff
### instaStoiner.py
Consists of class 'Friends' and has only one public function, all other funcs are for private usage, you can use them, but it's not supported.

Public functions definition:

	botfuncs.addNewFunc(funcPointer, *args)
	"""Puts the function into functions pool"""
